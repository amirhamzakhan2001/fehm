> **Library use:** Apply the [compatibility and execution contract](../../../COMPATIBILITY.md). Source roles, memory claims, command names, hooks, and integrations are instructions or prerequisites—not installed capabilities.

# F# Hooks

> This file extends [common/hooks.md](../../../core/common-hooks-standard/SKILL.md) with F#-specific content.

## PostToolUse Hooks

Configure in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

- **fantomas**: Auto-format edited F# files
- **dotnet build**: Verify the solution or project still compiles after edits
- **dotnet test --no-build**: Re-run the nearest relevant test project after behavior changes

## Stop Hooks

- Run a final `dotnet build` before ending a session with broad F# changes
- Warn on modified `appsettings*.json` files so secrets do not get committed

## Runtime prerequisites

See [the dependency ledger](../../../DEPENDENCIES.md) and this skill’s records in [dependencies.json](../../../dependencies.json). Native gstack/ECC CLIs, browsers, hooks, model tools, credentials, and memory stores must be available before invoking their steps. No runtime installation or execution has been performed. CSO requires its trusted helper; do not emulate that helper on the host.
