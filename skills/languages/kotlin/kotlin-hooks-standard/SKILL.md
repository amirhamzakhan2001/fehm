> **Library use:** Apply the [compatibility and execution contract](../../../COMPATIBILITY.md). Source roles, memory claims, command names, hooks, and integrations are instructions or prerequisites—not installed capabilities.

# Kotlin Hooks

> This file extends [common/hooks.md](../../../core/common-hooks-standard/SKILL.md) with Kotlin-specific content.

## PostToolUse Hooks

Configure in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

- **ktfmt/ktlint**: Auto-format `.kt` and `.kts` files after edit
- **detekt**: Run static analysis after editing Kotlin files
- **./gradlew build**: Verify compilation after changes

## Runtime prerequisites

See [the dependency ledger](../../../DEPENDENCIES.md) and this skill’s records in [dependencies.json](../../../dependencies.json). Native gstack/ECC CLIs, browsers, hooks, model tools, credentials, and memory stores must be available before invoking their steps. No runtime installation or execution has been performed. CSO requires its trusted helper; do not emulate that helper on the host.
