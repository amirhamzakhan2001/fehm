# Dart/Flutter Hooks

> This file extends [common/hooks.md](../../../core/common-hooks-standard/SKILL.md) with Dart and Flutter-specific content.

## PostToolUse Hooks

Configure in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

- **dart format**: Auto-format `.dart` files after edit
- **dart analyze**: Run static analysis after editing Dart files and surface warnings
- **flutter test**: Optionally run affected tests after significant changes

## Recommended Hook Configuration

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": { "tool_name": "Edit", "file_paths": ["**/*.dart"] },
        "hooks": [
          { "type": "command", "command": "dart format $CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Pre-commit Checks

Run before committing Dart/Flutter changes:

```bash
dart format --set-exit-if-changed .
dart analyze --fatal-infos
flutter test
```

## Useful One-liners

```bash
# Format all Dart files
dart format .

# Analyze and report issues
dart analyze

# Run all tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Regenerate code-gen files
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Check for outdated packages
flutter pub outdated

# Upgrade packages within constraints
flutter pub upgrade
```

## Runtime prerequisites

See [the dependency ledger](../../../DEPENDENCIES.md) and this skill’s records in [dependencies.json](../../../dependencies.json). Native gstack/ECC CLIs, browsers, hooks, model tools, credentials, and memory stores must be available before invoking their steps. No runtime installation or execution has been performed. CSO requires its trusted helper; do not emulate that helper on the host.
