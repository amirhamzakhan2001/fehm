# /epic-decompose

Reconcile the task breakdown for one epic issue.

```bash
node scripts/github-coordination.js decompose <issue-number> --repo <owner/repo>
```

What this does:

1. Reads the epic issue body for task checklists and dependency references.
2. Stores the decomposition in the coordination block.
3. Leaves task branches out of the workflow.
4. Appends a concise audit comment.

Compatibility aliases:

- `/plan`
- `/prp-plan`

## Runtime prerequisites

See [the dependency ledger](../../DEPENDENCIES.md) and this skill’s records in [dependencies.json](../../dependencies.json). Native gstack/ECC CLIs, browsers, hooks, model tools, credentials, and memory stores must be available before invoking their steps. No runtime installation or execution has been performed. CSO requires its trusted helper; do not emulate that helper on the host.
