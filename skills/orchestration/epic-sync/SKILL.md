# /epic-sync

Run a deterministic sync for epic issues.

```bash
node scripts/github-coordination.js sync --repo <owner/repo>
```

What this does:

1. Reads issue bodies as the canonical epic state.
2. Reconciles the coordination block with labels.
3. Writes a fresh local snapshot for each epic issue.
4. Keeps the SQLite cache aligned with GitHub.

Compatibility aliases:

- `/projects`
- `/work-items sync-github`

## Runtime prerequisites

See [the dependency ledger](../../DEPENDENCIES.md) and this skill’s records in [dependencies.json](../../dependencies.json). Native gstack/ECC CLIs, browsers, hooks, model tools, credentials, and memory stores must be available before invoking their steps. No runtime installation or execution has been performed. CSO requires its trusted helper; do not emulate that helper on the host.
