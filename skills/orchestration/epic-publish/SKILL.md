# /epic-publish

Publish a validated coordination update to GitHub.

```bash
node scripts/github-coordination.js publish <issue-number> --repo <owner/repo>
```

What this does:

1. Re-validates the epic before publishing.
2. Updates the coordination block in the issue body.
3. Appends a concise publish comment.
4. Records the final local snapshot.

Compatibility aliases:

- `/pr`
- `/prp-pr`

## Runtime prerequisites

See [the dependency ledger](../../DEPENDENCIES.md) and this skill’s records in [dependencies.json](../../dependencies.json). Native gstack/ECC CLIs, browsers, hooks, model tools, credentials, and memory stores must be available before invoking their steps. No runtime installation or execution has been performed. CSO requires its trusted helper; do not emulate that helper on the host.
